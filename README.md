A script set to assist in cutting down some of the monotony associated with running CMS2 and relaxing the force free model.
The script and file list is as follows:

#create_model_files.py and create_model_files_wrapper.py

#fff2_input_models.py and (wrapper coming soon)

#grab_sigmoid_fits_files.py and grab_sigmoid_download_wrapper.py

#cms2_dir
The location of your CMS2 directory, which create_model_files.py and grab_sigmoid_fits_files.py respectively use to copy and download files.
